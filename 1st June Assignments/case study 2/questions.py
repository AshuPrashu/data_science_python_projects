# 1.We shall use the same dataset used in previous assignment -digits.
# Make a 80-20 train/test split.[Hint:Explore datasets module from scikit learn]
#
# 2.Using scikit learn perform a LDA on the dataset. Find out the number of components
# in the projected subspace.[Hint:Refer to discriminant analysis moduleof scikit learn]
#
# 3.Transform the dataset and fit a logistic regression and observe the accuracy.
# Compare it with the previous model based on PCA in terms of accuracy and model complexity.
# [Hint: Project both the train and test samples to the new subspace]
